# raycaster prototype
small prototype to see if i can reasonably make a raycaster for my custom project in the unit games programming at swinburne. this has been developed on linux, for linux. don't really have any intentions to make this multi-platform for the moment, maybe in the future i will.

# pre-requisites
- make
- sfml

# credits
big thanks to dmitry v. sokolov for creating the [tinyraycaster](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraycaster) tutorial which has provided pretty much all of the code and knowledge that this project is based off.
